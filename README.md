In this project, you can found a simple App for Age of Empires 2. This App is aimed for those people who are learning about this game.
You can simply open the App and select the Enemy civ. The app will tell you what to expect (Typically).
The game is complex and it can change from game to game. But it is an overall criteria about that Civ.

To use this app, just Download it, unzip the folder and execute the .exe file. Thats all.
Im working in a web version of it.

Im a crappy dev so... Dont expect much.

Note: The .exe of course can pop-up an alert in your System about "being dangerous for your system".
Trust me... It is not. I mean, you can check it, it is a really simple app. It is just Microsoft being Microsoft.

Im taking ideas and any help you can give. Thanks.
